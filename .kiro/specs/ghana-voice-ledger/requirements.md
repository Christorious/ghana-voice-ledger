# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Ghana Voice Ledger is an autonomous AI voice agent Android application designed specifically for market traders in Ghana. The app continuously listens to seller-customer conversations during market hours, automatically identifies speakers, detects transaction information, and logs sales without any manual intervention. The primary goal is to provide fish market sellers with an effortless way to track their daily sales while they focus on their business, supporting Ghana's multilingual environment (English, Twi, and Ga) and working efficiently on budget Android devices.
