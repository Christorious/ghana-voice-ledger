# ðŸ”§ BUILD FIX APPLIED

**Time:** 2:30 PM, October 19, 2025

## Problem Identified:
Build failed with "Process completed with exit code 1"

## Root Cause:
The `app/build.gradle.kts` file was trying to read `local.properties` which doesn't exist in GitHub Actions environment.

## Fix Applied:
Modified `app/build.gradle.kts` to:
1. Handle missing `local.properties` gracefully
2. Use environment variables as fallback
3. Provide default values for all build config fields
4. Added missing build config fields (DEBUG_MODE, LOGGING_ENABLED, etc.)

## Changes Made:
```kotlin
// Before: Would fail if local.properties missing
buildConfigField("String", "GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY", "\"${properties.getProperty("GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY", "")}\"")

// After: Falls back to environment variables and defaults
buildConfigField("String", "GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY", "\"${properties.getProperty("GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY") ?: System.getenv("GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY") ?: ""}\"")
```

## Next Steps:

### YOU NEED TO:
1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add app/build.gradle.kts
   git add GITHUB_BUILD_INVESTIGATION.md
   git add BUILD_FIX_APPLIED.md
   git commit -m "Fix build configuration for GitHub Actions"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Wait for new build** (10-15 minutes)

3. **Check GitHub Actions** again:

## Expected Result:
The build should now complete successfully and generate the APK!
