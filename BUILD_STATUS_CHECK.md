**Timestamp:** October 19, 2025 - 2:15 PM

## Checking GitHub Actions Build Status

### Repository Information:
- **Repo:** https://github.com/Christorious/ghana-voice-ledger
- **Branch:** main
- **Latest Commit:** 8fd9734 (Add APK build monitoring tools)

### Expected Behavior:
GitHub Actions should automatically trigger on every push to main branch.

### Recent Commits That Should Have Triggered Builds:
1. 8fd9734 - Add APK build monitoring tools
2. f466894 - Add comprehensive verification report
3. 83de19d - Add all app icon densities ‚≠ê (This should build!)
4. e1e8a31 - Add simple APK download instructions
5. a6b1bcb - Trigger GitHub Actions APK build

### How to Check Build Status:

**Step 1:** Go to Actions page
```
https://github.com/Christorious/ghana-voice-ledger/actions
```

**Step 2:** Look for "Build APK" workflows

**Step 3:** Check the status of recent runs

### Possible Issues:

1. **Build is Running:** May take 10-15 minutes for Android builds
2. **Build Failed:** Check error logs in the failed workflow
3. **Workflow Not Triggered:** May need to manually trigger
4. **GitHub Actions Disabled:** Check repository settings

### Manual Trigger:

If automatic trigger didn't work, you can manually trigger:
1. Go to: https://github.com/Christorious/ghana-voice-ledger/actions
2. Click "Build APK" workflow on the left
3. Click "Run workflow" button (top right)
4. Select "main" branch
5. Click green "Run workflow" button
