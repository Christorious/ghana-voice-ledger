# Cultural Financial Cognition Research
## Designing Sales Representation Congruent with Market Women's Financial Thinking

> "We don't need to teach them our way of thinking about money. We need to learn theirs and build technology that speaks their language - both literally and cognitively."

---

## 🎯 Research Objective

**Goal**: Discover and design a sales representation system that is **completely congruent** with how Ghanaian market women naturally think about, remember, and process financial information.

**Why This Matters**: 
- Current digital ledgers impose Western accounting mental models
- This creates cognitive friction and information loss
- Market women have their own sophisticated financial cognition systems
- We should amplify their existing mental models, not replace them

## 🔍 Research Questions

### Primary Questions

1. **How do market women naturally chunk and remember their sales?**
   - By time of day? By customer? By product? By amount?
   - What are the natural "units" of memory?

2. **What financial metrics actually matter to them?**
   - Is it total sales? Profit? Cash in hand? Debt owed?
   - How do they think about "good day" vs "bad day"?

3. **How do they mentally track inventory and pricing?**
   - Visual memory? Physical counting? Spatial reasoning?
   - How do they adjust prices throughout the day?

4. **What are their natural financial rhythms and cycles?**
   - Daily? Weekly? Monthly? Market day cycles?
   - How do they think about time in relation to money?

5. **How do they handle mental math and estimation?**
   - What shortcuts do they use?
   - What's "close enough" vs "needs to be exact"?

6. **What cultural/spiritual beliefs influence their financial thinking?**
   - First sale of the day rituals
   - Lucky numbers or amounts
   - Giving and receiving practices

## 📊 Proposed Research Methods

### Phase 1: Deep Ethnographic Observation (4-6 weeks)

#### Method: "Shadow & Learn"

**Approach**:
- Spend full market days (6 AM - 6 PM) with 10-15 different vendors
- Don't just interview - **observe** their natural behavior
- Record (with permission) how they:
  - Talk about their sales
  - Remember transactions
  - Count money
  - Make decisions

**Key Observations to Capture**:

1. **Language Patterns**
   - How do they describe a sale? ("I sold 3 tilapia" vs "The tilapia went well today")
   - What metaphors do they use for money/sales?
   - How do they talk about profit vs revenue?

2. **Physical Behaviors**
   - Do they separate money into piles? (morning sales, afternoon sales, etc.)
   - Do they use physical objects as memory aids?
   - How do they organize their products spatially?

3. **Memory Strategies**
   - Do they remember individual customers?
   - Do they remember by product type or by time?
   - What triggers help them recall sales?

4. **Decision Points**
   - When do they check how much they've made?
   - What prompts them to adjust prices?
   - How do they decide when to close for the day?

---

### Phase 2: Cognitive Mapping Interviews (2-3 weeks)

#### Method: "Think-Aloud Protocol"

**Approach**: Ask vendors to reconstruct their day while thinking aloud

**Sample Questions**:

1. **End of Day Reconstruction**
   - "Tell me about your day. How did it go?"
   - "How do you know if you had a good day?"
   - "Can you remember your sales? How do you remember them?"

2. **Mental Organization**
   - "When you think about your sales, what comes to mind first?"
   - "How do you keep track in your head?"
   - "What helps you remember?"

3. **Financial Goals**
   - "What number are you trying to reach each day?"
   - "How do you know when you've reached it?"
   - "What do you do with the money you make?"

4. **Information Needs**
   - "What do you wish you knew about your sales?"
   - "What information would help you make better decisions?"
   - "What's hard to keep track of?"

---

### Phase 3: Participatory Design Sessions (3-4 weeks)

#### Method: "Co-Creation Workshops"

**Approach**: Work WITH market women to design the representation

**Activities**:

1. **Card Sorting Exercise**
   - Give them cards with different ways to show sales data
   - Ask them to organize by "makes sense" vs "confusing"
   - Discover their natural categorization

2. **Sketch Your Ideal View**
   - Provide paper, markers, stickers
   - Ask: "If you could see your sales any way you want, what would it look like?"
   - Don't constrain to digital - let them dream

3. **Story-Based Scenarios**
   - "Imagine you want to know if today was better than yesterday..."
   - "Imagine you want to see which fish sells best..."
   - How would they want to see this information?

4. **Physical Prototyping**
   - Use physical objects (coins, stones, cards) to represent sales
   - Let them arrange and rearrange
   - Observe their natural organizational patterns

## 🧠 Hypotheses to Test

Based on preliminary understanding of Ghanaian market culture:

### Hypothesis 1: Time-Based Chunking
**Theory**: Market women may naturally chunk their day into meaningful periods rather than continuous time.

**Examples**:
- "Morning rush" (6-9 AM)
- "Slow time" (9 AM-12 PM)
- "Lunch rush" (12-2 PM)
- "Evening" (2-6 PM)

**Test**: Do they remember sales by these periods rather than by clock time?

**Design Implication**: Show sales grouped by natural market rhythms, not hourly charts.

---

### Hypothesis 2: Relational Memory
**Theory**: Sales may be remembered in relation to people and stories, not just numbers.

**Examples**:
- "The woman who always buys 2 tilapia"
- "The man who negotiated hard today"
- "The customer who paid with exact change"

**Test**: Do they recall transactions by customer relationships?

**Design Implication**: Show sales with customer context, not just amounts.

---

### Hypothesis 3: Physical-Spatial Cognition
**Theory**: Market women may use spatial/physical mental models for tracking.

**Examples**:
- Visualizing money in piles
- Remembering products by their physical location
- Using body/hand gestures to indicate amounts

**Test**: Do they use spatial metaphors when describing sales?

**Design Implication**: Use spatial/visual representations, not just numbers and lists.

---

### Hypothesis 4: Comparative Rather Than Absolute
**Theory**: "Better than yesterday" may matter more than exact amounts.

**Examples**:
- "Today was slower than yesterday"
- "This week is better than last week"
- "Tilapia is selling better than mackerel"

**Test**: Do they think in comparisons rather than absolutes?

**Design Implication**: Emphasize trends and comparisons over exact numbers.

---

### Hypothesis 5: Goal-Oriented Tracking
**Theory**: Progress toward a daily/weekly goal may be more meaningful than total amount.

**Examples**:
- "I need 500 cedis today to pay school fees"
- "I'm halfway to my goal"
- "Just 100 more cedis and I'm done"

**Test**: Do they have specific targets they're working toward?

**Design Implication**: Show progress bars and goal completion, not just totals.

---

### Hypothesis 6: Profit-First Thinking
**Theory**: They may think about profit (what they keep) before revenue (what they sell).

**Examples**:
- "I made 200 cedis today" (meaning profit, not sales)
- Mentally subtracting costs automatically
- Thinking about "what I can take home"

**Test**: When they say "I made X," do they mean revenue or profit?

**Design Implication**: Show profit prominently, not just sales totals.

## 🎨 Potential Alternative Representations

Based on hypotheses, here are radically different ways to show sales data:

### Concept 1: "The Market Day Story"
**Metaphor**: A visual narrative of the day

**Design**:
```
☀️ Morning (6-9 AM)
   👥 8 customers
   🐟 Tilapia sold well
   💰 180 cedis

☁️ Midday (9 AM-2 PM)  
   👥 15 customers
   🐟 Mixed sales
   💰 320 cedis

🌙 Evening (2-6 PM)
   👥 12 customers
   🐟 Slow, reduced prices
   💰 150 cedis

📊 Today's Story: Good morning, slow evening
💵 Total: 650 cedis | Goal: 500 cedis ✅
```

**Why It Might Work**: Aligns with narrative memory and natural time chunks.

---

### Concept 2: "The Money Pile"
**Metaphor**: Visual representation of money accumulating

**Design**:
```
[Visual of coins/bills stacking up throughout the day]

Morning pile: 🪙🪙🪙 (180 cedis)
Midday pile:  🪙🪙🪙🪙🪙🪙 (320 cedis)
Evening pile: 🪙🪙🪙 (150 cedis)

Total pile: 🪙🪙🪙🪙🪙🪙🪙🪙🪙🪙🪙🪙 (650 cedis)

[Animated: coins flowing into pile as sales happen]
```

**Why It Might Work**: Aligns with physical money handling and spatial cognition.

---

### Concept 3: "The Customer Gallery"
**Metaphor**: Remember sales through people

**Design**:
```
Today's Customers:

👤 Regular Auntie (Tilapia, 2kg, 30 cedis) ⭐
👤 New customer (Mackerel, 1kg, 15 cedis)
👤 Negotiator (Tilapia, 3kg, 40 cedis) 💬
👤 Quick buyer (Herrings, 1kg, 12 cedis) ⚡
...

Best customers this week:
👤 Regular Auntie - 5 visits, 150 cedis
👤 Market neighbor - 3 visits, 90 cedis
```

**Why It Might Work**: Aligns with relational memory and social cognition.

---

### Concept 4: "The Progress Journey"
**Metaphor**: Walking toward a goal

**Design**:
```
Today's Goal: 500 cedis

[Visual: Path from start to goal]
🚶‍♀️━━━━━━━━━━━━━━🏁
     You're here! (650 cedis)
     
You passed your goal! 🎉
Extra: 150 cedis

Tomorrow's goal: 500 cedis
Start fresh: 🚶‍♀️━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━🏁
```

**Why It Might Work**: Aligns with goal-oriented thinking and progress tracking.

---

### Concept 5: "The Comparison View"
**Metaphor**: Better or worse than usual

**Design**:
```
Today vs Yesterday:
📈 Better! (+120 cedis)

This Week vs Last Week:
📈 Much better! (+450 cedis)

Tilapia vs Mackerel:
🐟 Tilapia: 15 sold
🐟 Mackerel: 8 sold
Winner: Tilapia! 🏆

Best day this month: Monday (780 cedis)
Today: 650 cedis (2nd best!)
```

**Why It Might Work**: Aligns with comparative thinking and pattern recognition.

---

### Concept 6: "The Rhythm Chart"
**Metaphor**: Visual pulse of sales activity

**Design**:
```
Sales Rhythm Today:

6 AM  ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂  (Slow start)
7 AM  ▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅  (Picking up)
8 AM  ████████  (Busy!)
9 AM  ▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅  (Steady)
10 AM ▂▂▂▂▂▂▂▂  (Quiet)
...

Your best hours: 8 AM, 12 PM, 5 PM
```

**Why It Might Work**: Aligns with temporal patterns and rhythm recognition.

## 💡 Key Principles

### 1. **Humility**
We don't know better than they do. We're here to learn.

### 2. **Respect**
Their financial cognition is sophisticated, not simple. It's different, not deficient.

### 3. **Co-Creation**
Design WITH them, not FOR them.

### 4. **Flexibility**
Be ready to throw away all our assumptions.

### 5. **Cultural Sensitivity**
Financial thinking is deeply cultural. Honor that.

### 6. **Practical Value**
The best design is the one they actually use and find helpful.

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Qualitative
- "This makes sense to me"
- "I can see my day clearly"
- "This helps me remember"
- "I understand my business better"

### Quantitative
- Time to understand the view (< 30 seconds)
- Accuracy of recall (can they reconstruct their day?)
- Frequency of use (do they check it regularly?)
- Preference (which view do they choose?)

### Impact
- Better financial decisions

## 🌟 The Vision

Imagine a sales view that:
- **Feels natural** - like how they already think
- **Respects culture** - honors Ghanaian financial cognition
- **Empowers** - helps them see patterns they couldn't see before
- **Delights** - makes them smile when they use it
- **Works** - actually helps them run their business better

This isn't just a UI redesign. It's **cognitive justice** - building technology that respects and amplifies indigenous ways of knowing.
