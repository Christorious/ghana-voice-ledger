\## Technical Architecture ### \*\*Core Components\*\*

\#### 1. \*\*Voice Recognition Engine\*\*

\```

Challenges to Solve:

- Background noise in busy markets
- Multiple speakers (seller + customers)
- Code-switching (English + Twi/Ga/Ewe)
- Varying accents and speaking speeds
- Product names in local languages

\```

\*\*Technical Approach\*\*:

- Use edge AI processing (on-device) for privacy and offline capability
- Train on Ghanaian English and local language patterns
- Implement noise cancellation specifically for market environments
- Create custom wake words to identify transaction moments

\#### 2. \*\*Transaction Detection System\*\* ```

Key Phrases to Recognize:

- "How much be this?" / "Sɛn na ɛyɛ?"
- Price negotiations
- Payment confirmations
- Quantity discussions
- "Give me change" / "My change"

\```

\*\*Detection Triggers\*\*:

- Price mentions (numbers + currency)
- Payment confirmations ("I dey pay", "Here be your money")
- Quantity + product combinations ("Two fish", "One cup salt")
- Completion phrases ("Thank you", "Go well")

\#### 3. \*\*Product Recognition\*\*

\```

Local Product Database:

Fish: Tilapia, Tuna, Mackerel, Herrings, Sardines Vegetables: Tomatoes, Onions, Pepper, Garden eggs Staples: Rice, Gari, Plantain, Yam

Seasonings: Salt, Maggi, Oil, Spices

\```

\*\*Recognition Strategy\*\*:

- Build product database with local names and variations
- Use context clues (typical market combinations)
- Learn seller's specific inventory over time
- Allow manual correction and teaching

\### \*\*User Experience Design\*\*

- Set typical selling hours and market days
2. \*\*Privacy Explanation\*\*
- "I only listen when you're selling. Your conversations stay private."
- Clear explanation of what data is stored and why
- Option to review and delete recordings

\#### \*\*Daily Usage\*\* (Luther's "Natural Sound")

1. \*\*Automatic Start\*\*
   1. App starts listening when phone detects market environment
   1. Visual indicator shows when actively listening
   1. Seller can pause/resume with simple voice command
1. \*\*Transaction Capture\*\*
   1. Subtle audio chime confirms transaction recorded
   1. No interruption to natural conversation flow
   1. Seller can correct if AI misunderstood
1. \*\*End of Day Summary\*\*
- Voice report: "Today you sold 45 Ghana cedis worth. Your best seller was fish."
- Simple visual dashboard showing daily progress
- Weekly and monthly summaries
