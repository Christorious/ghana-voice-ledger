# üîç GitHub Actions Build Investigation

**Time:** 2:20 PM, October 19, 2025

## Issue: APK Not Appearing in GitHub

You're right - we need to investigate why the APK hasn't been generated yet.

## Possible Reasons:

### 1. Build May Still Be Running
- Android builds can take 10-20 minutes
- Large dependencies need to download
- First build is always slower

### 2. Build May Have Failed
- Compilation error
- Missing dependency
- Configuration issue

### 3. Workflow May Not Have Triggered
- GitHub Actions might be disabled
- Workflow file might have syntax error
- Repository settings issue

## How to Check Right Now:

### Step 1: Open GitHub Actions Page
**Click this link:** https://github.com/Christorious/ghana-voice-ledger/actions

### Step 2: Look for Workflow Runs
You should see a list of workflow runs with:
- Workflow name: "Build APK"
- Status icon (yellow/green/red)
- Commit message
- Time started

### Step 3: Check the Status

**If you see üü° Yellow (In Progress):**
- Build is still running
- Wait 5-10 more minutes
- Refresh the page

**If you see ‚úÖ Green (Success):**
- APK is ready!
- Click on the run
- Scroll to "Artifacts" section
- Download "debug-apk"

**If you see ‚ùå Red (Failed):**
- Click on the failed run
- Click on "build" job
- Read the error message
- Share the error with me to fix

**If you see NOTHING:**
- Workflow didn't trigger
- Need to manually trigger it
- Or there's a configuration issue

## Manual Trigger Instructions:

If no builds are showing up, manually trigger one:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Christorious/ghana-voice-ledger/actions
2. Click "Build APK" in the left sidebar
3. Click "Run workflow" button (top right, green button)
4. Select "Branch: main"
5. Click the green "Run workflow" button
6. Wait 10-15 minutes
7. Refresh and check for artifacts

## What I Need From You:

Please check the GitHub Actions page and tell me:

1. **Do you see any workflow runs?** (Yes/No)
2. **If yes, what's the status?** (Yellow/Green/Red)
3. **If red, what's the error message?**
4. **How many workflow runs do you see?**

This will help me understand what's happening and fix it quickly.
