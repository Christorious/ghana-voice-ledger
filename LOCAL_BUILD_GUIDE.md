# Local Build Guide

## 🎯 Quick Summary

**The local build currently fails due to Java version compatibility issues.** 

**✅ Recommended Solution: Use GitHub Actions** (builds successfully with Java 17)

## 🔍 The Issue

- **Your Local Java**: Java 8 (`1.8.0_441`)
- **Project Requirements**: Java 11+ (for Gradle 8.2 + Android Gradle Plugin 8.1.4)
- **Result**: Version compatibility conflict

## 🚀 Solutions

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended) ✅

1. **Push your changes to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Go to your repository's Actions tab**
   - Visit: https://github.com/Christorious/ghana-voice-ledger/actions

3. **Download the APK**
   - Wait for the build to complete (5-10 minutes)
   - Click on the successful build
   - Download the `debug-apk` artifact
   - Extract and install the APK on your device

### Option 2: Upgrade Local Java ⚙️

1. **Install Java 11 or higher**
   - Download from: https://adoptium.net/
   - Or use your package manager

2. **Set JAVA_HOME environment variable**
   ```cmd
   set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-11.0.x-hotspot
   ```

3. **Run the local build**
   ```cmd
   .\build-local.bat
   ```

### Option 3: Use Existing Build Scripts 📝

We've provided two local build scripts that detect the issue and provide guidance:

- **`build-local.bat`** - Windows batch file (simpler)
- **`build-local.ps1`** - PowerShell script (more features)

Both scripts will:
- ✅ Check your Java version
- ⚠️ Warn about compatibility issues  
- 💡 Provide helpful error messages
- 🚀 Suggest using GitHub Actions as alternative

## 🎉 Why GitHub Actions Works

- **Java 17**: Modern, compatible version
- **Ubuntu Environment**: Clean, consistent build environment
- **Automated**: No local setup required
- **Reliable**: Same environment every time
- **Fast**: Builds in 5-10 minutes

## 📱 Installing the APK

1. **Enable Unknown Sources** on your Android device
   - Settings → Security → Unknown Sources (or Install Unknown Apps)

2. **Transfer the APK** to your device
   - USB, email, cloud storage, etc.

3. **Install** by tapping the APK file

## 🔧 Build Status

- **GitHub Actions**: ✅ Working (Java 17)
- **Local Build**: ❌ Fails (Java 8 compatibility)
- **Solution**: Use GitHub Actions or upgrade to Java 11+

**💡 Pro Tip**: GitHub Actions is actually more reliable than local builds because it uses a clean, consistent environment every time!
