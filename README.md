## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Hedgehog (2023.1.1) or later
- Android SDK 34
- Kotlin 1.9.0+
- Java 17+

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/voiceledger/ghana-voice-ledger.git
   cd ghana-voice-ledger
   ```

2. **Configure local properties**
   ```bash
   cp local.properties.example local.properties
   # Edit local.properties with your SDK path and API keys
   ```

3. **Set up API keys**
   - Google Cloud Speech API key
   - Firebase configuration
   - Analytics keys (see local.properties.example)

4. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

5. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   # Run unit tests
   ./gradlew test
   
   # Run integration tests (requires connected device/emulator)
   ./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest
   ```
   
   For detailed integration test documentation, see [INTEGRATION_TESTS.md](INTEGRATION_TESTS.md)

6. **Generate coverage reports**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew jacocoTestReport
   ```

   The HTML report is available at `app/build/reports/jacoco/jacocoTestReport/html/index.html`. To enforce the 70% minimum coverage threshold locally, run:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew jacocoTestCoverageVerification
   ```

   See [docs/COVERAGE.md](docs/COVERAGE.md) for detailed coverage guidance.
