## Tips for Best Results

### Voice Recognition Tips

1. **Speak Naturally**: No need to speak slowly or unnaturally
2. **Reduce Background Noise**: Voice recognition works best in moderate noise, but very loud environments may affect accuracy
3. **Complete Transactions**: Let conversations finish naturally - the app detects when a sale is complete
4. **Use Product Names Consistently**: The app learns your vocabulary over time

### Getting Accurate Prices

- Always state the final price clearly: "That's twenty cedis" or "Pay forty-five cedis"
- For negotiations, the final agreed price is what gets recorded
- If you spot an error, edit the transaction immediately

### Managing Products

- **Add Variants**: If you sell different types (e.g., "fresh tilapia", "smoked tilapia"), add them as product variants
- **Set Price Ranges**: Set typical price ranges for products to catch errors
- **Use Categories**: Organize products by category for easier searching

### Battery Life

- **Enable Smart Sleep Mode**: Pauses voice monitoring during extended silence
- **Set Market Hours**: App only listens during your business hours
- **Low Power Mode**: Reduces processing on low battery
